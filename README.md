# CNN-Model-For-Pothole-Detection
Developed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for pothole detection using image inputs. The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset and validated using a dedicated validation set. Implemented functionality in main.py to input an image and process it through the pre-trained model for accurate pothole detection. The dataset can be accessed through the provided link. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a8u8BWbKIVPVBXbgXsvfaR_6Pzh7UH4m/view?usp=drive_link
